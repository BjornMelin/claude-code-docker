## Usage

### Starting the Container

Use the main docker-compose file:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm claude-code
```

Or with the convenience script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

### Working with Claude Code

Once inside the container:

1. **Start Claude Code**: Run `claude` in any directory
2. **Clone Projects**: Use `/workspace` to clone and work on repositories
3. **Use Git**: Your SSH keys and git config are available
4. **Multi-Language Development**: Both Node.js and Python are ready to use
5. **Package Management**: Use smart aliases based on your selections
6. **Isolated Development**: Work on branches/features separate from your host

### Smart Package Management Aliases

The container automatically creates aliases based on your package manager choices:

#### Node.js Development

```bash
# Universal aliases (work with any selected package manager)
ni <package>        # Install package
na <package>        # Add package to project
nr <script>         # Run npm script
ndev               # Install dev dependencies
nbuild             # Build project

# Examples:
ni typescript      # Installs typescript with your selected manager
na express         # Adds express to your project
nr start           # Runs npm start script
```

#### Python Development  

```bash
# Universal aliases (work with any selected package manager)
pi <package>        # Install package
pir                # Install from requirements.txt
pidev              # Install dev dependencies

# UV-specific aliases (when uv is selected)
pirun <command>     # Run command in uv environment
pisync             # Sync dependencies with uv
piadd <package>     # Add package with uv

# Examples:
pi flask           # Installs flask with your selected manager
pir                # Installs from requirements.txt
pirun python app.py # Runs python with uv (if selected)
```

#### Container Information

```bash
./container-info.sh    # Show container configuration
claude-info            # Show Claude Code status (if alias exists)
```

### Performance Monitoring

Check your package manager performance:

```bash
# Time package installations to see the speed difference
time ni lodash           # With pnpm: ~1-3 seconds
time pi requests         # With uv: ~1-3 seconds

# Compare with traditional managers:
# npm install lodash     # Would take ~10-30 seconds
# pip install requests   # Would take ~5-15 seconds
```

### Multi-Language Project Workflow

**Starting a new Node.js project:**

```bash
cd /workspace
mkdir my-node-project && cd my-node-project
npm init -y  # Creates package.json
ni express typescript  # Fast installation with your package manager
claude  # Start Claude Code for development
```

**Starting a new Python project:**

```bash
cd /workspace
mkdir my-python-project && cd my-python-project

# With uv (auto-creates virtual environment)
pirun python -m venv .  # Creates venv if using pip
pi flask fastapi       # Fast installation

claude  # Start Claude Code for development
```

**Working on existing projects:**

```bash
cd /workspace
git clone git@github.com:username/project.git
cd project

# Node.js project
ni                     # Install dependencies fast
nr test               # Run tests

# Python project  
pir                   # Install from requirements.txt fast
pirun pytest          # Run tests (with uv)

claude                # Start Claude Code
```

### Managing Virtual Environments

#### With uv (Automatic)

```bash
# uv handles virtual environments automatically
pi <package>          # Installs in project-specific environment
pirun <command>       # Runs in the correct environment
```

#### With pip (Manual)

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/WSL
pi <package>             # Install in virtual environment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package Manager Issues

**pnpm not found or not working:**

```bash
# Verify pnpm installation
which pnpm
pnpm --version

# Rebuild container with pnpm
NODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**uv not found or not working:**

```bash
# Verify uv installation  
which uv
uv --version

# Rebuild container with uv
PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER=uv docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Slow package installations:**

```bash
# Check if you're using high-performance package managers
echo "Node: $NODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER, Python: $PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER"

# Switch to high-performance setup
nano .env  # Set NODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm, PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER=uv
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors:

```bash
# Rebuild with correct UID/GID
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Or run setup again to regenerate .env
./setup.sh
```

### Container Won't Start

1. Check Docker is running: `docker info`
2. Verify WSL: `grep microsoft /proc/version`
3. Check file permissions: `ls -la .`
4. Validate configuration: `docker-compose config`
5. Check package manager selection: `cat .env | grep PACKAGE_MANAGER`

### Shell Configuration Issues

**Wrong shell selected:**

```bash
# Edit .env file
nano .env
# Change PREFERRED_SHELL=bash (or zsh/fish)
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Shell config not loading:**

```bash
# Verify shell config path in .env
echo $SHELL_CONFIG_PATH
# Check if file exists and is readable
ls -la $SHELL_CONFIG_PATH
```

**Package manager aliases not working:**

```bash
# Check if aliases are loaded
alias | grep -E "(ni|pi|cc)"

# Restart shell or source config
exec $SHELL
```

### Performance Issues

**Package operations still slow:**

```bash
# Verify you're using high-performance managers
container-info

# Check for correct package manager selection
echo "Using: $NODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER for Node.js, $PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER for Python"

# Clear caches and rebuild
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

**Container startup slow:**

```bash
# Check if package manager caches are being used
docker volume ls | grep claude-code

# Rebuild without cache if needed
docker-compose build --no-cache --pull
```

### Multi-Language Issues

**Python packages not found:**

```bash
# Check Python environment
python --version
which python
which pip # or which uv

# Verify package manager selection
echo $PYTHON_PACKAGE_MANAGER
```

**Node.js packages not found:**

```bash
# Check Node.js environment
node --version
which node
which npm # or which pnpm/yarn

# Verify package manager selection  
echo $NODE_PACKAGE_MANAGER
```

### Volume Mapping Issues

**Custom directories not accessible:**

```bash
# Use volume helper to check mappings
./volume-helper.sh

# Verify paths in override file
cat docker-compose.override.yml

# Check if host directories exist
ls -la /path/to/host/directory
```

**Package manager configs not loading:**

```bash
# Check if package manager config files are mapped
ls -la ~/.npmrc ~/.pnpmrc ~/.yarnrc.yml

# Verify config file paths in .env
grep CONFIG_PATH .env
```

### Claude Code Authentication Issues

1. Ensure internet connectivity in container
2. Check Anthropic API status
3. Try clearing Claude Code config: `rm -rf ~/.claude` (inside container)
4. Verify API key if using environment variables

### File Access Issues

1. Verify workspace directory: `ls -la /workspace` (inside container)
2. Check git configuration: `git config --list`
3. Verify SSH keys are accessible: `ls -la ~/.ssh`
4. Use volume helper for custom mappings: `./volume-helper.sh`

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-Shell Support

The container supports multiple shells with their respective frameworks:

**Zsh (default):**

- Includes Oh My Zsh
- Supports .zshrc inheritance
- Default themes and plugins

**Bash:**

- Uses existing .bashrc
- Compatible with most existing configurations
- Reliable and widely supported

**Fish:**

- Modern shell with auto-suggestions
- Uses config.fish for configuration
- Built-in features and syntax highlighting

### Custom Environment Variables

Edit `.env` file to customize:

```bash
# Container settings
CONTAINER_NAME=my-claude-env
CONTAINER_USERNAME=myuser
PREFERRED_SHELL=bash

# Path configurations  
SHELL_CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/.bashrc

# Custom working directory
CONTAINER_WORKING_DIR=/workspace
```

### Docker Compose Overrides

For complex configurations, use `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  claude-code:
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /mnt/c/SharedFolder
        target: /workspace/shared
    environment:
      - CUSTOM_VAR=value
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

### Multiple Container Instances

Run multiple isolated environments:

```bash
# Copy project directory
cp -r claude-code-docker claude-code-project1

# Edit configuration
cd claude-code-project1
nano .env  # Change CONTAINER_NAME

# Run separate instance
docker-compose up -d
```

## Security Considerations

- SSH keys are mounted read-only for security
- Claude Code configuration is isolated in container volumes
- Container runs as non-root user with matching host UID/GID
- Host file system access is limited to explicitly mapped directories
- Custom mappings can be set to read-only for additional protection

## Cleanup

### Quick Cleanup

```bash
./cleanup.sh
```

### Manual Cleanup Options

**Remove Container and Images:**

```bash
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f
```

**Remove Project Directory:**

```bash
rm -rf ~/claude-code-docker
```

**Reset Claude Code Configuration:**

```bash
docker volume rm claude-code-docker_claude-code-config
```

**Remove All Custom Mappings:**

```bash
rm docker-compose.override.yml
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Setup Tips

1. **Use the interactive setup** for first-time configuration
2. **Choose your preferred shell** during setup - easier than changing later
3. **Map commonly used directories** during initial setup
4. **Use presets** for quick configuration of common development scenarios

### Usage Tips  

1. **Authenticate once** - credentials persist between sessions
2. **Clone fresh repos** in /workspace for isolated development
3. **Use git inside container** - all your keys and config are available
4. **Work on separate branches** without affecting your host repos
5. **Use the volume helper** for custom directory mappings

### Performance Tips

1. **Use WSL file system paths** (not /mnt/c/) for better performance
2. **Limit custom mappings** to directories you actually need
3. **Use read-only mappings** for configuration files
4. **Clean up unused containers** regularly with cleanup script

### Development Workflows

1. **One container per major project** for isolation
2. **Use preset configurations** for consistent team setups  
3. **Map team-shared directories** for collaboration
4. **Version control your .env** file (without secrets) for team sharing
